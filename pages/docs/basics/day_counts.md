A *day count* is used to convert dates to a numeric representation for financial maths.

A date consists of 12 months of varying lengths and occasional leap days.
As a result of this variation there are many possible ways to convert the amount of time between
two dates into a number. While counting the number of days between two dates is simple, there
are many different ways to convert the amount of time to a fraction of a year.
Each day count specifies a specific set of rules for the conversion.
Different rules are used in different markets and for different products.

The standard approach is based on converting the period between two dates to a *year fraction*.
A year fraction is a floating point number, where one year is represented by 1 and half a year by 0.5.

Most day counts are relatively simple, operating solely on the two dates, returning the year fraction.
Some day counts are more complicated, needing additional information about an associated schedule.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention) for more background information.


## Day Count

The `strata-basics` project includes a comprehensive implementation of day count conventions.
The key interface is `DayCount` which defines methods to obtain and query a specific day count.

Each day count implementation has a unique name.
This can be used to obtain the day count via the static method `DayCount.of(String)`:

```java
DayCount dayCount = DayCount.of("Act/360");
```

All available day counts can be listed using the static method  `DayCount.extendedEnum()`.

Common day counts can also be obtained using static constants on `DayCounts`:

```java
DayCount dayCount = DayCounts.ACT_360;
```

Once a day count is obtained, two methods are available to obtain the year fraction:

```java
double yf = dayCount.yearFraction(LocalDate, LocalDate);
double yf = dayCount.yearFraction(LocalDate, LocalDate, ScheduleInfo);
```

Both methods convert the period of time between two dates to a floating point number.
The first handles all simple day counts, the second allows additional information about the schedule to be passed in.

> Certain day count implementations cannot give an answer without the schedule information.
> As such, those implementations will throw an exception when called without `ScheduleInfo`.


## Standard Day Counts

The following standard day counts have been implemented.
Each has a string name which acts as a unique key to obtain the day count.
They are also available as constants on the `DayCounts` class.
For more information on each, see the Javadoc of `DayCounts`:

First, the underlying schedule period is obtained treating the first date as the start of the schedule period.<br />

schedule frequency, working forwards or backwards from the known regular schedule date.<br />
An end-of-month flag is used to handle month-ends.<br />
If the period is not a stub then the schedule period is treated as a nominal period below.<br />
Third, the result is calculated as the sum of a calculation for each nominal period.<br />
The actual days between the first and second date are allocated to the matching nominal period.<br />
Each calculation is a division. The numerator is the actual number of days in
the nominal period, which could be zero in the case of a long stub.<br />
The denominator is the length of the nominal period  multiplied by the frequency.<br />
The first day in the period is included, the last day is excluded.</td>

time a year is added the last valid day in February is chosen.<br />
The remaining period is then processed by a simple division.<br />
The numerator is the actual number of days in the remaining period.<br />
The denominator is the actual number of days in the year from the adjusted start date.<br />
The first day in the period is included, the last day is excluded.<br />
