The position loader is used to load positions.
It is one of a number of [loaders]({{site.baseurl}}/loaders) included in Strata.


## Loader

Trades can be loaded using the [`PositionCsvLoader`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/loader/csv/PositionCsvLoader.html)

```
ResourceLocator locator = ResourceLocator.ofFile(filename);
ValueWithFailures<List<Position>> trades = PositionCsvLoader.load(locator);
```


## Format

The trades file is a CSV-formatted file.
The columns may be specified in any order.
The CSV format is flexible, and the input can specify positions in various ways.


### Example

This example file specifies three positions, a simple security, an ETD future and an ETD option.

```
Strata Position Type, Id Scheme, Id,     Security Id, Quantity, Exchange, Contract Code, Expiry,  Put Call, Exercise Price
SEC,                  OG,        123431, AAPL,        12
FUT,                  OG,        123421, ,            2,        ECAG,     FGBL,          2017-06
OPT,                  OG,        123431, ,            15,       ECAG,     OGBL,          2017-06, P,        5.12
```

Note that Microsoft Excel prefers the CSV file to have no spaces after the comma.

### Determining the type dynamically

In the formats above, "Strata Position Type" is defined as being mandatory.
In fact, it is possible to omit the column and let the parser determine it automatically.
To do this, it examines the presence or absence of the "Expiry" and "Put Call" columns.
