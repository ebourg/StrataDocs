---

The trade loader is used to load FRA, Swap, Security and Term Deposit trades.
It is one of a number of [loaders]({{site.baseurl}}/loaders) included in Strata.


## Loader

Trades can be loaded using the [`TradeCsvLoader`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/loader/csv/TradeCsvLoader.html)

```
ResourceLocator locator = ResourceLocator.ofFile(filename);
ValueWithFailures<List<Trades>> trades = TradeCsvLoader.load(locator);
```


## Format

The trades file is a CSV-formatted file.
The columns may be specified in any order.
The CSV format is flexible, and the input can specify trades in various ways.


### Example

This example file specifies one FRA and one Swap.

```
Strata Trade Type, Id Scheme, Id,     Trade Date, Convention,            Buy Sell, Period To Start, Tenor, Fixed Rate, Notional
Fra,               OG,        123401, 2017-06-01, GBP-LIBOR-3M,          Buy,      P2M,             ,      0.5,        1000000
Swap,              OG,        123411, 2017-06-01, GBP-FIXED-1Y-LIBOR-3M, Buy,      P1M,             P5Y,   0.4,        2000000
```

Note that Microsoft Excel prefers the CSV file to have no spaces after the comma.

#### Variable notional/rate

Both formats of swap (convention and full details) support variable notionals and variable fixed rates.
The information is contained in one or more rows that follow the base swap row.
The additional rows only need to contain the minimal information for the variable element.

| Column name           | Mandatory?  | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Strata Trade Type     | Mandatory   | The type of the trade, "Variable" |
| Start Date            | Mandatory   | The unadjusted date when the variable element changes, such as "2017-06-01", see [accepted formats]({{site.baseurl}}/common_formats/) |
| Notional              | Optional    | The notional amount that applies from the start date onwards |
| Fixed Rate            | Optional    | The fixed rate, as a percentage, that applies from the start date onwards |

It is permitted to define a row with neither notional nor fixed rate specified.
The variable element applies to all legs and cannot be controlled per leg.

This example file has both variable notional and fixed rate:
