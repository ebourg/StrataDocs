An FX Swap is a financial instrument that represents the exchange of an equivalent amount
in two different currencies between counterparties on two different dates.

For example, an FX swap might represent the payment of USD 1,000 and the receipt of EUR 932
on the *near* date, and the payment of EUR 941 and the receipt of USD 1,000 on the *far* date.


## Key classes

An FX Swap is represented in Strata using the [`FxSwap`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/fx/FxSwap.html) class.
The `FxSwap` class stores details of the product that was agreed.
The trade details are stored in [`FxSwapTrade`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/fx/FxSwapTrade.html) class.

An `FxSwap` can be created as follows:

```java
FxSwap fx = FxSwap.ofForwardPoints(CurrencyAmount.of(Currency.USD, 1000),  // amount
                                   EUR                                     // other currency
                                   0.932,                                  // FX rate at near date
                                   0.009,                                  // forward points
                                   LocalDate.of(2015, 6, 15),              // near date
                                   LocalDate.of(2015, 9, 15));             // far date
```

The `strata-measure` module provides high-level risk measures for FX Swaps.
The main entry point is
[`FxSwapTradeCalculations`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/measure/fx/FxSwapTradeCalculations.html).

The following measures are available:

* present value, and associated sensitivity
