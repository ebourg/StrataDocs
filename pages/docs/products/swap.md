A rate swap is a financial instrument that represents the exchange of streams of payments.
The swap is formed of legs, where each leg typically represents the obligations
of the seller or buyer of the swap. In the simplest vanilla interest rate swap,
there are two legs, one with a fixed rate and the other a floating rate.
Many other more complex swaps can also be represented.

For example, a swap might involve an agreement to exchange the difference between
the fixed rate of 1% and the GBP LIBOR rate every 3 months for 2 years.

The Strata swap instrument covers four types of legs - Fixed, Ibor rate, Overnight rate and Inflation rate.
Other types of swap have their own instruments.


## Key classes

A rate swap is represented in Strata using the [`Swap`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/swap/Swap.html) class.
The `Swap` class stores details of the product that was agreed.
The trade details are stored in [`SwapTrade`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/swap/SwapTrade.html) class.

A `Swap` can be created using a builder as follows:

```java
SwapLeg payLeg = RateCalculationSwapLeg.builder()
  .payReceive(PayReceive.PAY)
  .accrualSchedule(PeriodicSchedule.builder()
    .startDate(LocalDate.of(2014, 9, 12))
    .endDate(LocalDate.of(2021, 9, 12))
    .frequency(Frequency.P6M)
    .businessDayAdjustment(BusinessDayAdjustment.of(MODIFIED_FOLLOWING, HolidayCalendarIds.USNY))
    .build())
  .paymentSchedule(PaymentSchedule.builder()
    .paymentFrequency(Frequency.P6M)
    .paymentDateOffset(DaysAdjustment.NONE)
    .build())
  .notionalSchedule(NotionalSchedule.of(Currency.USD, 100_000_000))
  .calculation(FixedRateCalculation.of(0.015, DayCounts.THIRTY_U_360))
  .build();

SwapLeg receiveLeg = RateCalculationSwapLeg.builder()
  .payReceive(PayReceive.RECEIVE)
  .accrualSchedule(PeriodicSchedule.builder()
    .startDate(LocalDate.of(2014, 9, 12))
    .endDate(LocalDate.of(2021, 9, 12))
    .frequency(Frequency.P3M)
    .businessDayAdjustment(BusinessDayAdjustment.of(MODIFIED_FOLLOWING, HolidayCalendarIds.USNY))
    .build())
  .paymentSchedule(PaymentSchedule.builder()
    .paymentFrequency(Frequency.P3M)
    .paymentDateOffset(DaysAdjustment.NONE)
    .build())
  .notionalSchedule(NotionalSchedule.of(Currency.USD, 100_000_000))
  .calculation(IborRateCalculation.of(IborIndices.USD_LIBOR_3M))
  .build();

Swap swap = Swap.of(payLeg, receiveLeg);
```

## Risk measures

The `strata-measure` module provides high-level risk measures for rate swaps.
The main entry point is
[`SwapTradeCalculations`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/measure/swap/SwapTradeCalculations.html).

The following measures are available:

* present value, detailed breakdown, and associated sensitivity
* single-node bucketed gamma
* par rate
* par spread
* cash flows
* accrued interest
* leg initial notional
* leg present value
* currency exposure
* current cash

These measures are also available using the calculation API.

The `strata-pricer` module provides lower-level pricing support for rate swaps:

* `DiscountingSwapTradePricer`, see [Javadoc]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/pricer/swap/DiscountingSwapTradePricer.html).
* `DiscountingSwapProductPricer`, see [Javadoc]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/pricer/swap/DiscountingSwapProductPricer.html).
